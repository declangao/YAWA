# Yet Another Weather App
A simplistic weather forecast app 

## About
This is actually something I wrote at a interview. The requirement was to build a simple app to show the weather for a city for the next 7 days. And it must have the following feathures:

* Allow a user to enter a city name
* Use [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org) REST API.
* Display temperature and description for each day.
* User can tap a day to see more detail for that day, including day, city, temp, min, max description and weather icon (optional).

Not much to say about the app except it uses [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley) library to handle asynchronous HTTP requests and support library v7 to implement material design.
